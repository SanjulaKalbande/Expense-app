# expense_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started


I have developed an expense tracker app using Flutter that allows users to easily track their expenses and
gain insights into their spending habits.
• The app provides a user-friendly interface where users can input the date and category of their expenses.
• By saving this information, the app generates a visually appealing chart that illustrates the distribution of
expenses across different categories.
